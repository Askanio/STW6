ScrewTurnWiki uses the following JS and CSS dependencies

[ScrewTurnWiki]
=======================
These live in the 'stw' folder. You will need the Typescript SDK installed for the Typescript compiler to work.

The typescript files are 'compiled' into Javascript when the web project is compiled, by the typescript 
targets in the csproj file. The JS files still need to be present for the AzureDeploy to work (this 
issue is due to Azure sites not having the Typescript SDK installed and is likely to be fixed in Typescript v1)

The .map files are generated by the Typescript compiler and are used for debugging in Chrome and Visual Studio,
they are not included in the final package.

The typescript-ref folder contains files to assist Typescript, none of the js files are included by the bundler or on the site.

All the file.js files are bundled and minified by the ASP.NET bundler.
